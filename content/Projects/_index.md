## Intro to NLP Course
I've been developing a course on introduction to NLP.
You can download the some of the material here: [Intro to NLP - Beta Material](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ahg_IClK8R7Khs0kFonJl9QPsSP06g?e=37H679).
Don't hesitate to contact me if you find it interesting :)

## TClass

TClass is an attempt to develop an open-source text classifier tool and provide useful NLP models for this type of problem. It is on its very first steps, and so far I've only started experimenting with some models and state-of-the-art approaches. You can check its development on this
[GitHub Repository (TClass)](https://github.com/gennsev/tclass).


## Fake Tweets Detector

This project is an attempt to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones arenâ€™t. It is based on the [Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/) Kaggle competition. You can check it on this
[GitHub Repository (fake-tweets-detector)](https://github.com/gennsev/fake-tweets-detector).
